# LockSession

## Presentation

On Mac OS X, there is no way to lock the screen using a keyboard shortcut (like Windows+L on Windows).

LockSession is a Mac OS X preference pane that allows you to configure a keyboard shortcut to lock your session.

## Installation

This plugin requires Mac OS X 10.5 and higher.

 * Download the plugin (coming soon).
 * Uncompress the downloaded file (if needed).
 * Open the file to install the preference pane.
 * Configure your shortcut.
 * Push the *Install* button.
 * That's it! You can now use your keyboard shortcut to lock your session.
